# Sky-Watch-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Sky Watch is a web application that allows travelers to check the weather outlook for multiple cities. The motivation behind building this project was to help travelers plan their trips more effectively by providing them with up to date weather information. The application solves the problem of having to search for weather information in different locations separately. It consolidates the current and future weather conditions for a city, making it easy for users to make informed decisions about their travel plans.
